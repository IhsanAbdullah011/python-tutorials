"""
these are hte most common data types you will interact with.
the computer will recognise them to be different from each other and therefore you can use them differently
for instance you can do maths with integers but not with strings, you can concatinate with strings but not with integers,
lists can store different bits of information separated by a ',', booleans hold true or false values etc...

this was jsut an intro and basic explenation of the various data types we may deal with. as we progress we will look at
their uses later and when and why we may use them
