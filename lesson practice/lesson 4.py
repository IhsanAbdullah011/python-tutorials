activity 2: DOB calculator

- make a simple program that asks the user for their name, age, what month and day they were born
- the program should say "hi [name]"
- the program should then use the age, month and day entered to figure out their DOB and display the following:
  "you were born in [date of birth]/[month of birth]/[year of birth]"

hints:
- you will need to use input()
- you will need to use int()
- you will need vairables
- you will need concatination
