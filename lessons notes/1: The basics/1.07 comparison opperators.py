# Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
# Checks!!! --> True or False

# Example 1: Equality (==)
a = 10
b = 5
print("is a equal to b? ", a == b) 

# name = "Abdullah" --> MAKING name the same as abdullah
# name == "Abdullah" --> Checking is name the same as Abdullah? --> True or Flase

# Example 2: Not equal to (!=)
print("is a not equal to b? ", a != b)

# Example 3: Greater than (>)
print("is a greater than b? ", a > b)

# Example 4: Less than (<)
print("is a less than b:", a < b)

# Example 5: Greater than or equal to (>=)
a = 10
b = 5
c = 10
print("is a greater than or equal to c:", a >= c)

# Example 6: Less than or equal to (<=)
print("is b less than or rqual to a:", b <= a)

# Example 7: Combining comparison operators
x = 7
y = 3
z = 9
print(z > x < y)  # True, because 9 > 7 and 7 > 3
